<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com). -->

A movie poster is a tool which is primarily used to express the very nature of a movie. On one hand it's main goal is to express the crucial moments, emotions and message of the film. On the other hand it's a commercial product intending to attract a viewer, therfore it involves psychological aspects which reflect the social climate of the time and the place. From that point of view a composition and colors of a movie poster allow us to understand more clearly the emotional side of the epoch in a given country.

Another interesting aspect of this topic is discovering the correlation between movie success (its popularity and box office) and its poster colors. This analysis can be used for determining the optimal balance of colors for a movie poster.

In this research the correlation between movie poster colors and genre is also considered. The obtained information allows determining the patterns for each genre and can be used for creating new posters radically different from those that customers are used to in that increasing a probability of commercial success.

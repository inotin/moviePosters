          <h5>Overview</h5>

          <p>A movie poster is a tool which is primarily used to express the very nature of a movie.
            On one hand it's main goal is to express the crucial moments, emotions and message of the film.
            On the other hand it's a commercial product intending to attract a viewer, therfore it involves psychological aspects which reflect the social climate of the time and the place.
            From that point of view a composition and colors of a movie poster allow us to understand more clearly the emotional side of the epoch in a given country.
            <br><br>Another interesting aspect of this topic is discovering the correlation between movie success (its popularity and box office) and its poster colors.
            This analysis can be used for determining the optimal balance of colors for a movie poster.<br><br>
          In this research the correlation between movie poster colors and genre is also considered. The obtained information allows determining the patterns for each genre and can be used for creating new posters
          radically different from those that customers are used to in that increasing a probability of commercial success. </p>

          <h5>Analysis</h5>
          <h6 style="margin-top:40px">Number of movies per year</h6>

          <p> The number of movies is increasing exponencially throughout years. Though it is interesting that there was a stagnation in 2008-2010 and in 2017-2018.
            I would suggest that it is due to the random nature of sampling, i.e. I used only about 1/7 of the whole cinematography and even though the sampling is based on the uniform distribution I would not ommit that kind of issue.
            <br>There is a significant drop in 2020 which is obviously connected with the corona virus crisis. The numbers for 2021 and 2022 are not the final yet and it will be curious to see how it changes.

          <h6 style="margin-top:70px">Mean color distributions vs Year</h6>

          <p>It's curious that initially the ratio of black color was pretty high which cn be connected with presence of only black and white movies.
            Then in the forties the amount of black decreased which I connect with the desire of the society to compensate the negative emotions during and after the 2nd World War.
            In foloowing periods the amount of black increases, while white and other colors are less used. The reason for that is probably the increase in the amount of horror and thriller movies in this period,
            which use black as a main color.

          <h6 style="margin-top:70px">Colors and genres</h6>

            <p> As it was expected the horror and thriller movies are the ones that use black the most. In the same time comedy is the one that uses primarily white colors.
              I would also admit the extensive use of RGB colors in animation, adventure and family movies.
              Another observation is that the orange color (255,136,0) which is usually associated with skin color is used the least in science fiction whereas the use of blue (0,136,255) is the most extensive in this genre.
              The reason for that is probably that science fiction posters involve technology which is associated with blue and usually replaces the human presence (orange color).
